- 👋 Hi, I’m @UnityDogGaming04
- 👀 I’m interested in a wide variety of things, including space, computers and programming, esoteric programming languages, you get the idea.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to design hardware that natively runs OISC programs
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet, I don't yet know how to use GitHub, and I only know the basics of a few programming languages.
- 📫 How to reach me, email kyle04smith@gmail.com
